Place translation files here.

Translation files should be named:
- subscription-priority-for-apfs-{locale}.po
- subscription-priority-for-apfs-{locale}.mo

For example:
- subscription-priority-for-apfs-es_ES.po
- subscription-priority-for-apfs-es_ES.mo

Note: As of WordPress 4.6, when a plugin is hosted on WordPress.org, 
translations are automatically loaded. The load_plugin_textdomain() 
function is no longer required.

For GitHub-hosted plugins, translations can still be placed here 
and WordPress will load them automatically based on the 
Text Domain and Domain Path headers in the main plugin file.
